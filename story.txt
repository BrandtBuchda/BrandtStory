There once was a college student named Brent. Brent was a good student but not without his faults. He suffered from a common, but deadly, affliction known as procrastination. Over the years Brent had learned to cope with his condition until one day he told himself that this would be the semester he finally put his demon to rest. He started out strong. He went to class, took notes, and kept on top of his classwork. As the weeks dragged on, however, he slowly descended back into that dark, dark hole. One night he found himself cramming for an upcoming final when it suddenly occurred to him that he had to write a short story for a computer science course.

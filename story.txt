There once was a college student named Brent. Brent was a good student but not without his faults. He suffered from a common, but deadly, affliction known as procrastination. Over the years Brent had learned to cope with his condition until one day he told himself that this would be the semester he finally put his demon to rest. He started out strong. He went to class, took notes, and kept on top of his classwork. As the weeks dragged on, however, he slowly descended back into that dark, dark hole. One night he found himself cramming for an upcoming final when it suddenly occurred to him that he had to write a short story for a computer science course.

An observer in the shadows saw his predicament.
  "Big mood," he thought, comiserating but not helping. The observer stood for a while, watching Brent struggle with his work, but did nothing.
He soon decided that this was boring, and he was in the middle of Star Trek: TNG S6E14 "Face of the Enemy" and that he wanted to get back to watching it. But he was editing a text file in vim, so first he needed to google "How to exit vim".
